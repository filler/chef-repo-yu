# group.cf is the only dependency of failsafe.cf; it sets the group name and 
# mothership for the ITS group using Cfengine and allows for group-specific 
# failsafe policy implementation in bundle group_failsafe.
#
# Failsafe.cf is intended to restore order to agents with syntax errors
# in their policy files, so clients can always pull policy updates from
# the master.  As such, failsafe.cf and any dependencies are very important
# files and should not be edited unless there is a compelling technical
# reason to do so and the edit has been thoroughly tested.
#
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# If you modify this file, copy your changes into the set of policy you use to
# bootstrap clients.  For dcsunix, this is:
#
# /var/cfengine/masterfiles/linux/usr/local/src/cfengine3bootstrap/
